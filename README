Description: prints a diamond within a square to the screen.
Compile by: type "make" in the command line to compile
Run by: typing ./pa1 width height borderCh diamondCh 
        for example: ./pa1 11 9 42 57
Normal Output:  
./pa1 11 9 42 57

Abnormal output
 ./pa1test 999999999999 abc123 20 20

        Converting "999999999999" base "10": Result too large

        "abc123" is not an integer

        border_ch(20) must be an ASCII code in the range [33 - 126]

        diamond_ch(20) must be an ASCII code in the range [33 - 126]

        border_ch(20) and diamond_ch(20) must be different

I tested this program by making unit test cases. I also compared the output of
the program to the correct output by using diff. 

1) How do you print the value of the string that is the 1st arg in strtol?
    enter the command "x/s $i0"

2) How do you print the decimal value of the base that is the 3rd arg in strtol?
    enter the command "p/d $i2"

3) How do you print the hex value of &endptr that is the 2nd arg in strtol?
    enter the command "p/x $i1"

4) How do you print the value returned by strtol?
   Show two ways:
   a) Using the name of the local variable you use to hold the return value
     enter the command "p/d num"

   b) Displaying the value in the register used to return the value 
     enter the command "p/d $o0"

5) How do you print the character endptr is pointing to?
    enter the command "p/c *endptr"

6) How do you print the entire nul-terminated string endptr is pointing to?
    enter the command "p *endptr@10"

7) How do you print the decimal value of the global variable errno at this 
   point?
    enter the command "p/d errno"

8) What is the Git command to show the current state of your working tree?
    git status

9) What is the Git command to discard any changes made to a file since its last    commit?
    git reset

10) What is the Git command to display the differences between the local version    of a file and the version last committed?
    git diff
